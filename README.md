# War

A simple simulation of a game of war, 
Each player gets 26 cards out of a randomly shuffled new deck.
In every round each player draws out the first card from the top of his hand, the player with the greater card wins the round and gets all the cards.
If both players draw equal cards, ITS WAR TIME - they each draw 5 more cards and then compare the last cards drawn.
The first player left with no cards LOSES.
